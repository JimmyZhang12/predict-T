# McPAT XML Auto Gen

This project takes a GEM5 statistics file and config file, and builds a system
that can be serialized to XML for use with McPAT. Although it is configured to
work with GEM5 as the cycle accurate simulator, the utility is designed to be
easily converted and extended to fit other simulators.

### Structure

The Gem5 device tree and the McPAT device tree are not the same, thus
a conversion from one tree to another is required. The McPAT tree is as
follows:

- Root
  - System
    - Core [0,...,*n*]
      - BranchPredictor
      - Branch Target Buffer (BTB)
      - ICache Translation Lookahead Buffer (TLB)
      - ICache
      - DCache TLB
      - DCache
    - L2 Cache [0,...,*n*]
    - L1 Directory [0,...,*n*]
    - L2 Directory [0,...,*n*]
    - L3 Cache
    - Network on Chip (NoC)
    - Memory Controller (MC)
    - Network Interface (NIU)
    - PCIe
    - Flash Controller

### Versioning and Features

Version 1.0 - Initial code, converts device tree, supports parsing for multi
core gem5 stats with heterogenous cores, and heterogenus private L2 caches.

### Future Work

In the future this needs to be expanded on and improved on. There are more xml
parameters and stats that can be specified to improve the power
approximations, also there should be RUBY coherent caches supported with NoCs
for each level of coherent cache.
